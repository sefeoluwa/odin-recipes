      <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Noodles are a type of food made from unleavened dough rolled flat and cut, stratched, or extruded, into long strips or strings.</p>
    <p>Noodles are my go to food when I'm feeling too lazy to cook something serious or during days of premium sapa. Also, it is really easy to make and doesn't take time at all. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Some of this ingredients may be unnecessary and you can just cook your pack of noodles as is. If you're however feeling like doing more, here's how to do it.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pack(s) of noodles of your choosing</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons of water</li>
        <li>4 shredded carrot</li>
        <li>One teaspoon of chili pepper</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons of oil</li>
        <li>150g of chopped peas or bean</li>
        <li>2 chopped tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to cook</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1: Boil the noodles.</strong> This should not take more than 8 to 9 minutes except you like soggy noodles. You should first add your water, then oil, and then put the noodles in to boil.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong>Once boiled, take out the noodles and strain. Set it aside for now</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> On low heat, add oil to a pan, once the oil is sufficiently hot, add your chopped veggies. Fry for 4 to 5 minutes and stir in between. </li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong>Add in your noodles and mix thoroughly. It should still be on the fire for a minute.</li>
        <li>Your noodles is ready to be served. Serve hot with turkey or chicken on the side.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>PS: This is how professional chefs say we should cook it. I would usually just throw in all the ingredients at once and wait for them to cry for help. And then I eat it straight from the pot.</strong></p>
